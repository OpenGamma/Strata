 * The SourceProvider interface is used to expose a data store.

 * and for this reason minimal assumptions are made about the
 * form of the data store (for example, a key value data store,
 * a relational database and so on) and the only method that
 * needs to be implemented is {@link #get(StandardId)}. Note
 * that overriding other methods may improve performance,
 * specifically the {@link #bulkGet(Iterable)} and
 * {@link #changedSince(Iterable, Instant)} methods.
 * <p>
 * This interface is analogous to the {@link Source} interface.
 * The Source interface is provided for use by callers inside
 * the calculation server, whereas this one is for use by
 * developers integrating a data store. This different focus
 * explains the slightly different apis.
