Using Strata
------------

Documentation for Strata can be found at https://strata.opengamma.io.

To use Strata Java SE 8u40 or later is required.
The JAR files are available in [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:com.opengamma.strata):

```
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.opengamma.strata</groupId>
  <artifactId>strata-measure</artifactId>
  <version>2.3.0</version>
</dependency>
```

The JAR files, along with the command line tool and examples, can also be obtained from
the [Strata Releases](https://github.com/OpenGamma/Strata/releases) page on GitHub.


Building Strata
---------------

The source code can be cloned using [git](http://git-scm.com/) from GitHub:

```
  git clone https://github.com/OpenGamma/Strata.git
```

The projects use [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) as the build system.
Version 3.5.0 or later is required.
Simply run this command to compile and install the source code locally:

```
  mvn install
```

Strata is based on Java SE 8.
Our continuous integration regularly builds on both Java 8 and Java 11.
When using Java 8, version 8u40 or later is required due to bugs in earlier versions.
We do not recommend use of non-LTS releases, such as Java 9, 10 and 12.

The Strata examples project includes a GUI based on JavaFX.
On Java 8, this will be excluded from compilation if JavaFX is not available in the JDK.
On Java 11, OpenJFX is included as a jar file from Maven Central, so the GUI is always compiled.

We recommend builds of OpenJDK from providers other than Oracle, notably
[Amazon Corretto](https://aws.amazon.com/corretto/) and [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/).

see the [documentation](https://strata.opengamma.io).


Status
------

Strata is well-maintained, tested and functional.
It is used in production as the core of [OpenGamma SaaS Analytics](https://opengamma.com/).
The API will be maintained with backwards compatibility in mind.
