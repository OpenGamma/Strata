/**
 * A function that calculates multiple values for a target using multiple sets of market data.

 * The values must be converted into each of the reporting currencies before they are returned.
 * <p>
 * A function should implement this interface if at least one of the values it calculates contains a currency amount
 * and it needs to perform the conversion into the reporting currencies itself.
 * <p>
 * It is recommended that functions which calculate currency amounts implement {@link EngineMultiFunction} and
 * return an implementations of {@link CurrencyConvertible}. This allows the calculation engine to convert
 * currency values into the reporting currencies. This interface is should only be implemented by
 * functions where the automatic currency conversion is insufficient.
 * <p>
 * If none of the calculated values contain currency amounts it is recommended to implement {@link EngineMultiFunction}.
