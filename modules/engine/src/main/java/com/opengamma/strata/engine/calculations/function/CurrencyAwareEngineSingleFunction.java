 * A function that calculates currency values for a target using multiple sets of market data.

 * <p>
 * It is recommended that functions which calculate currency amounts implement {@link EngineSingleFunction} and
 * return an implementation of {@link CurrencyConvertible}. This allows the calculation engine to convert
 * currency values into the reporting currencies. This interface is should only be implemented by
 * functions where the automatic currency conversion is insufficient.
