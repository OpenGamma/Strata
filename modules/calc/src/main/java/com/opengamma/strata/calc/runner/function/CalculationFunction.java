 * <li>{@link #supportedMeasures()}
 *  - the set of measures that can be calculated
 * <li>{@link #naturalCurrency(CalculationTarget, ReferenceData)}
 *  - the "natural" currency of the target
 * <li>{@link #requirements(CalculationTarget, Set, CalculationParameters, ReferenceData)}
 *  - the market data requirements for performing the calculation
 * <li>{@link #calculate(CalculationTarget, Set, CalculationParameters, CalculationMarketData, ReferenceData)}
 *  - perform the calculation
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * If any of the calculated values contain any currency amounts and implement {@link CurrencyConvertible}
