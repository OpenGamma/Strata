 * The primary classes for interacting with the calculation runner are in the
 * {@code com.opengamma.strata.calc} package.
 * <p>
 * The calculations are performed by implementations of
 * {@link com.opengamma.strata.calc.runner.CalculationFunction CalculationFunction}.
 * Each calculation may be customized and controlled by an implementation of
 * {@link com.opengamma.strata.calc.runner.CalculationParameter CalculationParameter}.
