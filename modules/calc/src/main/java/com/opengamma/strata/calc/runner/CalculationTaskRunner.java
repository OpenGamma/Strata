/**
 * Component that provides the ability to run calculation tasks.
 * <p>
 * This interface is the lower-level counterpart to {@link CalculationRunner}.
 * It provides the ability to calculate results based on {@link CalculationTasks}.
 * Unless you need to optimize, the {@code CalculationRunner} is a simpler entry point.
 * <p>
 * The purpose of the runner is to produce a grid of results, with a row for each target
 * and a column for each measure. The targets and columns that define the grid of results
 * are passed in using an instance of {@code CalculationTasks}.
 * <p>
 * The {@code CalculationTasks} instance is obtained using a
 * {@linkplain CalculationTasks#of(CalculationRules, List, List) static factory method}.
 * It consists of a list of {@code CalculationTask} instances, where each task instance
 * corresponds to a single cell in the grid of results. When the {@code CalculationTasks}
 * instance is created for a set of trades and measures some one-off initialization is performed.
 * Providing access to the instance allows the initialization to occur once, which could
 * be a performance optimization if many different calculations are performed with the
 * same set of trades and measures.
 * <p>
 * Once obtained, the {@code CalculationTasks} instance may be used to calculate results.
 * The four "calculate" methods handle the combination of single versus scenario market data,
 * and synchronous versus asynchronous.
 * <p>
 * A calculation runner is typically obtained using the static methods on this interface.
 * The instance contains an executor thread-pool, thus care should be taken to ensure
 * the thread-pool is correctly managed. For example, try-with-resources could be used:
 * <pre>
 *  try (CalculationTaskRunner runner = CalculationTaskRunner.ofMultiThreaded()) {
 *    // use the runner
 *  }
 * </pre>
