/**
 * A convention defining how to calculate stub periods.
 * <p>
 * A {@linkplain PeriodicSchedule periodic schedule} is determined using a periodic frequency.
 * This splits the schedule into "regular" periods of a fixed length, such as every 3 months.
 * Any remaining days are allocated to irregular "stubs" at the start and/or end.
 * <p>
 * The stub convention is provided as a simple declarative mechanism to define stubs.
 * The convention handles the case of no stubs, or a single stub at the start or end.
 * If there is a stub at both the start and end, then explicit stub dates must be used.
 * <p>
 * For example, dividing a 24 month (2 year) swap into 3 month periods is easy as it splits exactly.
 * However, a 23 month swap cannot be split into even 3 month periods.
 * Instead, there will be a 2 month "initial" stub at the start, a 2 month "final" stub at the end
 * or both an initial and final stub with a combined length of 2 months.
 * <p>
 * The 'ShortInitial' or 'LongInitial' convention causes the regular periods to be determined
 * <i>backwards</i> from the end date of the schedule, with remaining days allocated to the stub.
 * <p>
 * The 'ShortFinal' or 'LongFinal' convention causes the regular periods to be determined
 * <i>forwards</i> from the start date of the schedule, with remaining days allocated to the stub.
 * <p>
 * The 'None' convention may be used to explicitly indicate there are no stubs.
 * <p>
 * The 'Both' convention may be used to explicitly indicate there is both an initial and final stub.
 * In this case, dates must be used to identify the stubs.

   * For example, if the initial date of the sequence is 2014-06-20 and the periodic
   * frequency is 'P2W' (week-based), then the implied convention is 'DayFri',
