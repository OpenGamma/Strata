 * A market data identifier that identifies observable data.

 * It is always of type {@code Double}.
 * <p>
 * An observable ID contains three pieces of information:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>A {@link StandardId} identifying the market data. This ID can come from any system. It might be
 *   an OpenGamma ID, for example {@code OpenGammaIndex~GBP_LIBOR_3M}, or it can be an ID from a market
 *   data feed, for example {@code BloombergTicker~AAPL US Equity}.</li>
 *
 *   <li>A {@link FieldName} indicating the field in the market data record containing the data. See
 *   the {@code FieldName} documentation for more details.</li>
 *
 *   <li>A {@link MarketDataFeed} indicating where the data should come from. This is typically chosen
 *   by the market data rules. It is important to note that the standard ID is not necessarily related
 *   to the feed. There is typically a mapping step in the market data system that maps the standard ID
 *   into an ID that can be used to look up the data in the feed.</li>
