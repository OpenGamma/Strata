 * A convention defining how to round a number.

 * This defines a standard mechanism for rounding a {@code double} or {@link BigDecimal}.
 * Since financial instruments have different and complex conventions, rounding is extensible.
 * <p>
 * Note that rounding a {@code double} is not straightforward as floating point
 * numbers are based on a binary representation, not a decimal one.
 * For example, the value 0.1 cannot be exactly represented in a {@code double}.
 * <p>
 * The standard implementation is {@link HalfUpRounding}.
 * Additional implementations may be added by implementing this interface.

 * All implementations of this interface must be immutable and thread-safe.
