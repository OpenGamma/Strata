   * <p>
   * First, the underlying schedule period is obtained treating the first date as the start of the schedule period.
   * <p>
   * Second, if the period is a stub, then nominal regular periods are created matching the

   * <p>
   * Third, the result is calculated as the sum of a calculation for each nominal period.
   * The actual days between the first and second date are allocated to the matching nominal period.
   * Each calculation is a division. The numerator is the actual number of days in
   * the nominal period, which could be zero in the case of a long stub.
   * The denominator is the length of the nominal period  multiplied by the frequency.
   * The first day in the period is included, the last day is excluded.

   * Defined by the Association Francaise des Banques in September 1994 as 'Base Exact/Exact'
   * in 'Definitions Communes plusieurs Additifs Techniques'.
   * <p>
   * OpenGamma implements this day count based on the original French documentation
   * without the ISDA clarification. The ISDA document translates "Periode d'Application"
   * to "Calculation Period" and then assigns the regular ISDA meaning of "Calculation Period".
   * Examination of the original French indicates that "Periode d'Application" simply means
   * the period that the day count is applied to, not a regular periodic schedule.
   * <p>
   * In addition, the ISDA document adds a roll back rule stating that if the period ends
   * on the 28th February it should be rolled back to the 28th, or to the 29th in a leap year.
   * Unfortunately, this rule has a strange effect when implemented, with one day receiving
   * two days interest and the next receiving no interest:
   * <pre>
   *  From 2004-02-28 to 2008-02-27, ISDA rule = 3 + 365 / 366
   *  From 2004-02-28 to 2008-02-28, ISDA rule = 4 + 1 / 366
   *  From 2004-02-28 to 2008-02-29, ISDA rule = 4 + 1 / 366
   * </pre>
   * (Other strange examples occur from 2004-02-29 and 2003-03-01).
   * <p>
   * OpenGamma interprets the roll back rule to be that if the period ends on the <i>29th</i> February
   * it should be rolled back to the 28th, or to the 29th in a leap year.
   * This change (which can be argued is closer to the original French than the ISDA "clarification")
   * results in the following:
   * <pre>
   *  From 2004-02-28 to 2008-02-27, OpenGamma interpretation = 3 + 365 / 366
   *  From 2004-02-28 to 2008-02-28, OpenGamma interpretation = 4
   *  From 2004-02-28 to 2008-02-29, OpenGamma interpretation = 4 + 1 / 366
