/**
 * An assert helper that provides useful AssertJ assertion
 * methods for {@link CurrencyAmount} instances.
 * <p>
 * These allow {code CurrencyAmount}s to be inspected in tests in the
 * same fluent style as other basic classes.
 * <p>
 * So the following:
 * <pre>
 *   CurrencyAmount result = someMethodCall();
 *   assertEquals(result.getCurrency(), USD);
 *   assertEquals(result.getAmount(), 123.45, 1e-6);
 * </pre>
 * can be replaced with:
 * <pre>
 *   CurrencyAmount result = someMethodCall();
 *   assertThat(result)
 *     .hasCurrency(USD)
 *     .hasAmount(123.45, within(1e-6));
 * </pre>
 * or:
 * <pre>
 *   CurrencyAmount result = someMethodCall();
 *   CurrencyAmount expected = CurrencyAmount.of(USD, 123.45);
 *   assertThat(result).isEqualTo(expected, within(1e-6));
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * In order to be able to use a statically imported assertThat()
 * method for both {@code CurrencyAmount} and other types, statically
 * import {@link BasicProjectAssertions#assertThat(CurrencyAmount)}
 * rather than this class.
