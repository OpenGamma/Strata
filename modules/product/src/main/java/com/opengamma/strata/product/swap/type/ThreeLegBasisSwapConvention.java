/**
 * A market convention for three leg basis swap trades.
 * <p>
 * This defines the market convention for a single currency basis swap.
 * The convention is formed by combining three swap leg conventions in the same currency.
 * <p>
 * The market price is for the difference (spread) between the values of the two floating legs.
 * This convention has three legs, the "spread leg", the "spread floating leg" and the "flat floating leg". 
 * The "spread leg" represented by the fixed leg will be added to the "spread floating leg" 
 * which is typically the leg with the shorter underlying tenor. 
 * Thus the "spread leg" and "spread floating leg" will have the same pay/receive direction. 
 * <p>
 * To manually create a convention, see {@link ImmutableThreeLegBasisSwapConvention}.
 * To register a specific convention, see {@code ThreeLegBasisSwapConvention.ini}.
