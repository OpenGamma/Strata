/**
 * A market convention for Ibor-Ibor swap trades.
 * <p>
 * This defines the market convention for a Ibor-Ibor single currency swap.
 * The convention is formed by combining two swap leg conventions in the same currency.
 * <p>
 * The market price is for the difference (spread) between the values of the two legs.
 * This convention has two legs, the "spread leg" and the "flat leg". The spread will be
 * added to the "spread leg", which is typically the leg with the shorter underlying tenor.
 * The payment frequency is typically determined by the longer underlying tenor, with
 * compounding applied.
 * <p>
 * For example, a 'USD 3s1s' basis swap has 'USD-LIBOR-1M' as the spread leg and 'USD-LIBOR-3M'
 * as the flat leg. Payment is every 3 months, with the one month leg compounded.
 * <p>
 * To manually create a convention, see {@link ImmutableIborIborSwapConvention}.
 * To register a specific convention, see {@code IborIborSwapConvention.ini}.
