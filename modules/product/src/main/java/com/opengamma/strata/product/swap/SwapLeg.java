/**
 * A single leg of a swap.
 * <p>
 * A swap leg is one element of a {@link Swap}.
 * In most cases, a swap has two legs, one expressing the obligations of the seller
 * and one expressing the obligations of the buyer. However, it is possible to
 * represent more complex swaps, with one, three or more legs.
 * <p>
 * This interface imposes few restrictions on the swap leg. A leg must have a start and
 * end date, where the start date can be before or after the date that the swap is traded.
 * A single swap leg must produce payments in a single currency.
 * <p>
 * In most cases, a swap will consist of a list of payment periods, but this is not
 * required by this interface. The {@link ResolvedSwapLeg} class, which this leg can
 * be converted to, does define the swap in terms of payment periods.
 * <p>
 * Implementations must be immutable and thread-safe beans.
